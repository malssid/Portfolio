            My name is Michael. I am currently a senior at the University of
            Rhode Island, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Cyber
            Security. I have long been fascinated with complex web applications,
            but I never really understood how they were constructed. In the
            summer of 2020, stuck in my home because of the Covid-19 pandemic, I
            decided to dig in and study HTML, CSS and Javascript. As I enter my final semester at URI, I am ready
            to apply my skills in the workplace as a software engineer. I am
            taking just one course in the Spring Semester, and available to
            begin working before I graduate in May 2022.
